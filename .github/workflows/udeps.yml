        # cargo-udeps uses unstable flags, so we are supposed to use a nightly toolchain.
        # However, it internally uses cargo-the-library from crates.io, which aligns with the stable toolchain.
        # This means that it effectively uses stable cargo, but nightly rustc, which can cause incompatibilities.
        # Example: The `test` cfg was turned into a userspace check-cfg in nightly rustc, while stable cargo still assumed it was a well-known cfg.
        # To mitigate this issue, we set RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1 to be able to use unstable flags with stable rustc.
